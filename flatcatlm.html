      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The Flat-headed Cat Prionailurus planiceps is one of the most unusual members of the cat 
family, with their long, narrow head and fla ened forehead. The Flat-headed Cat is found on 
Sumatra, Borneo and on the Malayan Peninsula but is likely ex nct in Thailand. Very li le is 
known about this species and the understanding of its current distribu on is based on a 
comparably low number of occurrence records </p>

      <h2>information</h2>
      <p>The Flat-headed Cat is one of the most endangered cat species in the world. Over 70% of 
their historical habitat has been converted to croplands, planta ons and other land cover 
types unsuitable to these cats. Remaining habitats are highly fragmented.There are some 
indica ons that Flat-headed Cats occur in secondary forest but there is very li le evidence 
that they are found in oil palm planta ons. Southeast Asia has the worldâ€™s highest 
deforesta on rate (e.g. over 1.3 million hectares of lowland forest are deforested annually 
on the island of Borneo) with Malaysia and Indonesia being among the largest palm oil 
producers. </p>

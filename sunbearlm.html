      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The Malayan Sun bear, or the Sun bear is the smallest member of the bear family. They are 
easily dis nguishable by their bib-shaped golden or white patch on their chest. These 
adorable bears are the least studied out of all 8 exis ng bear species. Maybe this is due to 
their shy nature and the type of habitat they reside – remote dense lowland forests of South 
East Asia.  </p>

      <h2>information</h2>
      <p>Sun bears are primarily nocturnal, but dayme ac vity has been observed in this species. 
Usually, they scour the forest looking for berries, figs, other varie es of fruits, and insects – 
especially beetle, termites and ants. Even so, it’s high up in the trees is where they excel, 
using their long, curved claws for climbing with ease and speed, and a long, slender tongue 
for extrac ng honey from bee nests. Hence, their nickname is “honey bear”. Like many other 
species, the Sun bear currently faces mul ple threats on a regional and na onal level; 
habitat loss, popula on fragmenta on, illegal hun ng and trading for tradi onal medicine 
and delicacies.  </p>

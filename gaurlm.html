      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Gaurs are found throughout mainland South and Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, 
Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Myanmar, India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, 
and Nepal. These animals don’t migrate and live in evergreen forests or semi-evergreen and 
moist deciduous forests and also occur in deciduous forest areas at the periphery of their 
range.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>information</h2>
      <p>Gaur prefer large, rela vely undisturbed forest tracts, hilly terrain, availability of water, and 
an abundance of forage in the form of grasses, bamboo, shrubs, and trees. Generally, gaur 
are most ac ve in the morning and evening. However, they can be ac ve by day or even 
become nocturnal, when living nearby human se lements. These sociable animals gather 
into herds, containing 8-11 or more individuals. A gaur herd includes females and one 
dominant male.  The home range of each herd covers about 78 sq. kilometers (30 sq. miles) 
territory. Bulls often congregate into bachelor herds while older males occasionally prefer 
living solitarily. Against a threat, the bull usually lowers its head and hind side, a acking the 
rival from the broadside with its horns. When alarmed, these animals give out a call known 
as a "whistling snort".</p>

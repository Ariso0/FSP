      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Banteng are considered one of the most beautiful cow species, their striking coats and white "socks" as well as impressive horns and big black eyes set them apart 
        from other bovines. a species of wild Southeast Asian cattle, family Bovidae (order Artiodactyla), found in hill forests. A shy animal resembling a domestic cow, 
        the banteng attains a shoulder height of about 1.5–1.75 m (60–69 inches).</p>

      <h2>information</h2>
      <p>Although banteng can be found in many places, there are only about 8000 wild banteng altogether.
        They live in different habitats in different areas including open dry deciduous forest and more 
        densely forested areas. Here you would often find them living in small groups. This group would 
        usually include females and their offspring of different ages and perhaps an adult male. 
        Males might live on their own or form groups with other males. In the breeding season males 
        compete to be the most dominant, which means they get to mate with more females. Large groups 
        are made up of up to 100 animals are sometimes seen but these are normally for a short time period.
         Where they have been studied in the wild, banteng are active both during the day and at night, 
         swapping between resting and moving around or eating. If you were watching them in the wild you 
         might expect to see more of them at dawn and dusk when they often emerge from thicker forest into 
         open areas to find food and socialise.Because they are shy and hard to see, you might expect that 
         wild banteng should be safe from human impacts, but this is not the case.</p>

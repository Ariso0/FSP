      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The proboscis monkeys are one of the typical and exclusive species of Borneo. They typically 
live along the rivers of the islands, in the mangroves and near the marshes and are a highly 
arboreal species to the point that occasionally they venture on the land only to forage.  </p>

      <h2>information</h2>
      <p>proboscis monkeys live in organized groups which are real harems made up of a dominant 
male, two to seven females and their respec ve offspring. They are also skilled swimmers 
thanks to their webbed limbs which help them escape from crocodiles, their main and 
fearsome predators. Another characteris c of these monkeys is the size of their belly which 
is directly propor onal to their par cular stomachs. The diet of these primates consists of 
leaves, seeds, immature fruits and, occasionally, also insects; their complex and large 
diges ve systems have par cular enzymes that help them to dispose of the cellulose of the 
plants and cancel the harmful effects of some  </p>

      <h2>Characteristics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>They have a brown-orange fur on the back, neck and head</li>
        <li>the arms, legs and tail are greyish. </li>
        <li>The male weighs 16-22 kg but can reach up to 30 kg and can reach a height of up to 
75 cm</li>
        <li>The females are smaller and typically weigh 7-12 kg and reach the 65 cm of height </li>
        <li>large nose that develops with age; while that of the females is much smaller, the 
nose of the males can be up to 18 cm long and serves essen ally as a sounding 
board, capable of producing a strong nasal intona on similar to the bass., as the 
deep sound they can emit is able to inmidate other males (and even their 
predators) and a ract many females during the phase of mating. </li>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The northern river terrapin is omnivorous, taking waterside plants and small animals such as 
clams.[7] The species prefers freshwater habitats and moves to brackish river mouths or 
estuaries in the breeding season (December–March), returning a er laying their eggs. 
Individuals have been known to undertake long seasonal migra ons of 50 to 60 miles to the 
sand banks where they were hatched. Females usually lay three clutches of 10–34 eggs 
each.</p>

      <h2>information</h2>
      <p>One of Asia's largest freshwater and brackish turtles. Carapace moderately depressed, with a 
vertebral keel in the young, which keel disappears in the adult; nuchal broader than long; 
first vertebral as broad in front as behind, or a little broader; vertebrals 2 to 4 subequal, 
much broader than long in the young, nearly as long as broad and as broad as the costals in 
the adult, the postero-lateral border of the third vertebral strongly concave. Plastron large, 
strongly angulate laterally in the young, convex in the adult, truncate anteriorly, angularly 
notched posteriorly; the width of the bridge exceeds the length of the posterior lobe; the 
longest median suture is that between the abdominals, the shortest that between the 
gulars, the latter never more than half that between the humerals; inguinal large, axillary 
smaller. Head rather small; snout pointed, produced, directed upwards; jaws with 
denticulated edge, upper feebly notched mesially; the width of the lower jaw at the 
symphysis nearly equals the diameter of the orbit. Limbs with transversely enlarged, band
like scales. </p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Milky strok has a small popula on in Cambodia, with birds occasionally wandering (in the 
non-breeding season) to Thailand. Historically it occurred naturally in Peninsular Malaysia, 
but all popula ons here originate from escapes or unsuccessful reintroduc on efforts, with 
another such popula on in Singapore. The vast majority of the world's popula on now 
exists in Indonesia, with recent records from Sumatra and Java (the strongholds) and 
Sulawesi (Eaton et al. 2021, eBird 2023), with no recent records from Sumbawa or Buton. </p>

      <h2>information</h2>
      <p>The Milky Stork is found predominantly in coastal mangroves. This bird has a diverse diet, 
feeding on small animals including shellfish, insects, fish and frogs.This stork has been 
observed to make use of several feeding mechanisms. Typically, it locates and captures prey 
by groping. This groping method sees the Milky Stork wading slowly through shallow waters 
with a par ally open bill submerged about three quarters in the water.When the prey 
touches this bill, the stork rapidly shuts its bill and swallows the item whole. The stork might 
rest for a minute a er swallowing a large fish, before it resumes its hunt.As with other 
wading bird species, the Milky Stork is somemes considered a minor pest within the 
aquaculture industry, if it feeds on fish and shrimps meant for commercial purposes.The 
Milky Stork is a generally silent bird, except in breeding colonies. Breeding tends to occur 
during the dry season, and usually lasts for three months.The Milky Stork lays a clutch of 1 to 
4 eggs, with the incuba on period esmated to be around a month. Both the male and 
females take turns nes ng.The eggs can hatch at different mes, so the oldest and youngest 
chicks can differ considerably in size. This puts the youngest and smallest chicks at a 
disadvantage, as feeding of the young begins before all of the eggs have hatched. With an 
equal distribu on of food, it is quite common for the youngest chicks to die of starva on.</p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The Painted Terrapin (Batagur borneoensis) is a large freshwater turtle (carapace length up 
to 50 cm) that inhabits parts of large rivers under dal influence. Its distribu on is limited 
geographically to Sumatra, southern Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo. </p>

      <h2>information</h2>
      <p>The Painted Terrapin, also known as the Painted Batagur, is a cri cally endangered 
freshwater turtle found in Malaysia, primarily along the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia in 
states like Terengganu and Kelantan. This species lives in brackish and freshwater 
ecosystems, including river estuaries, mangroves, and lowland wetlands. The terrapin gets 
its name from the vivid colors the males develop during the breeding seasonâ€”bright red 
stripes on their heads and white facial markings. It is primarily herbivorous, feeding on 
aqua c plants, fruits, and somemes small invertebrates. The species is nes ng-dependent, 
laying its eggs on sandy beaches near river mouths, making it vulnerable to egg poaching 
and habitat disturbance. In Malaysia, conserva on programs led by organiza ons like the 
Turtle Conserva on Society and the Department of Wildlife and Na onal Parks (PERHILITAN) 
focus on protec ng nes ng sites and raising hatchlings in cap vity before releasing them 
into the wild. Despite these efforts, the painted terrapin remains under threat due to illegal 
wildlife trade, habitat loss, and pollu on.</p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The Rhinoceros Hornbill has a prominent golden-yellow horn, called a casque, on the top of 
its beak. The casque is a hollow structure made up of keratin (the same material as human 
fingernails) and acts as a resonating chamber, amplifying the bird’s calls. </p>

      <h2>information</h2>
      <p>Buceros rhinoceros is confined to the Sundaic lowlands of extreme south 
peninsular Thailand (where it is locally considered to be endangered, and the only suitable 
habitat is in extensive primary forest in the Hala Bala area [Trisurat et al. 2013]), Sabah, 
Sarawak and Peninsular Malaysia, Kalimantan, Sumatra and 
Java, Indonesia and Brunei (BirdLife Interna onal 2001). It is locally ex nct in Singapore.It 
can be found in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak but is absent from the smaller 
States such as Melaka, Penang and the Federal Territories. Its stronghold remains in large 
forest complexes and protected areas (Davison 1987; Davison 1995; Lim & Tan 2000; Wells 
1999; Chong 1998; Chong 1993; Si Hawa Yam 1993; Si Hawa Yam et al. 1985; Ong et 
al. 2000; Choo and Teresa 2001; Norsham and Teresa 2001; Abdul Kadir Abu Hashim 2002; 
Wells 1999; Yeap & Perumal, in press; Wells 1990; Yong et al. 2011). In Peninsular Malaysia, 
most of these sites have been iden fied as Important Hornbill Landscapes (IHL), which are 
also IBAs and linked to the Central Forest Spine Masterplan for Peninsular Malaysia (Yeap & 
Perumal, in press). Forests adjacent to oil palm planta ons could also support the 
Rhinoceros hornbills (and other hornbill species), if they s ll remain sizeable (Pan 1987/88).</p>

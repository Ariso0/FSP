      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>In 1986 it was believed there could have been as many as 800 Sumatran rhinos remaining in
the wild. Now, more than 35 years later, official estimates suggest there are as few as 34-47
rhinos left in the wild.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>information</h2>
      <p>The Sumatran rhino has not had an easy ride. Research from the Marshall University in West 
Virginia recently shed light on just how long the Sumatran rhino population has been having 
difficulties. It seems that their numbers declined dramatically due to a climate shift as long 
as 9,000 years ago, and have not managed to bounce back since. 
More recently, widespread habitat loss and fragmentation have led to surviving animals 
struggling to meet and breed in the wild, while the threat of poaching still looms.</p>

      <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p>Sumatran rhinos can run fast and are very agile. They climb mountains easily and can 
negotiate very steep slopes and riverbanks. With the protection provided by the 
horns and rims of hard skin and cartilage on nose and head, they can easily break 
through the densest vegetation, leaving round tunnels for themselves.</p>

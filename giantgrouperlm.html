      <h2>information</h2>
      <p>The Giant Grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) is the largest bony fish found in coral reefs. It 
inhabits tropical and subtropical waters across the Indo-Pacific, ranging from the eastern 
coast of Africa to the Pacific islands and northern Australia. This species is typically found in 
shallow waters near coral and rocky reefs but can also be seen at depths of up to 100 
meters. It has a slow growth rate and long lifespan, somemes living up to 50 years in the 
wild. Giant groupers are carnivorous and feed primarily on fish, crustaceans, and even small 
sharks and turtles. They are known for their incredible suc on feeding technique, using their 
large mouths to pull prey in with a sudden gulp. Although usually solitary, they can be seen 
in pairs or small groups during breeding seasons. Overfishing and habitat destruc on have 
led to declining popula ons in some areas, and the species is currently listed as 
vulnerable.h ps://australian.museum/learn/animals/fishes/queensland-grouper- </p>
